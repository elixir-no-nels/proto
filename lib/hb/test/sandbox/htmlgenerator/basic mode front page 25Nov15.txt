- Explore cancer mutations (somatic variation)	
	- Are mutations for a group of tumors/patients (e.g. a particular cancer type) occurring in accessible regions in certain cell types?	
		The question of whether the mutations fall in accessible regions (DNase HS/FAIRE/Histone Chip-Seq) across cell types can be seen as a concrete instance of the more general question "How does a query track overlap with the different tracks of a suite", where: 

The query genomic track is the dataset of mutations that you want to study. It should be uploaded to Galaxy history using e.g. the tool __uf_tool__. 
(If you want to test with a sample track file, click here to load a __dt_tcga__)

The suite of tracks is the proxies of active regions (e.g. DNaseI accessibility), with separate tracks per cell type (collected in a GSuite).  It should be constructed using __page_cg__, for instance the tool __bs_tool__. (If you want to test with a sample track suite, click here to load a __dgs_dnase__)

After the necessary data (query track and track suite) has been collected to Galaxy history, the track of variants can be analyzed against active regions using the tool __tc_tool__.
	- Are mutations for a group of tumors/patients (e.g. a particular cancer type) preferentially located in certain chromatin states (in a given cell type)?	
		This question can be explored by analyzing enrichment of the mutations in regions associated with different chromatin states in a cell of interest.  Various genomic tracks can be used to denote chromatin state, including individual histone modifications or chromatin state tracks constructed computationally from combinations of several histone modifications. 

The question of whether the genomic variants fall in particular chromatin states (Histone Chip-Seq, computationally constructed tracks) in a given cell type can be seen as a concrete instance of the more general question "How does a single genomic track overlap with various other tracks from a suite", where:

The query genomic track is the dataset of mutations that you want to study. It should be uploaded to Galaxy history using e.g. the tool __uf_tool__. 
(If you want to test with a sample track file, click here to load a __dt_tcga__)

The suite of tracks is the different histone modifications/chromatin states, with separate tracks per modification/state (collected in a GSuite).  It should be constructed using __page_cg__, for instance the tool __bs_tool__. (If you want to test with a sample track suite, click here to load a __dgs_hist_k562__)

After the necessary data (query track and track suite) has been collected to Galaxy history, the track of variants can be analyzed against active regions using the tool __tc_tool__.
	- Do mutations for a group of tumors/patients (e.g. a particular cancer type) potentially disrupt regulation by certain transcription factors (in a given cell type)?	
		[Are the mutations preferentially located in binding sites for some transcription factor (in a given cell type)?]

This question can be explored by analyzing enrichment of the mutations in regions associated with binding for different transcription factors (TFs) in a cell of interest.  Various genomic tracks can be used to denote TF binding, including TF chip-seq, DamID or binding-motif-based computational predictions.

The question of whether the genomic variants fall in binding sites (TF Chip-Seq, computational prediction tracks) in a given cell type can be seen as a concrete instance of the more general question "How does a single genomic track overlap with various other tracks from a suite", where:

The query genomic track is the dataset of mutations that you want to study. It should be uploaded to Galaxy history using e.g. the tool __uf_tool__. 
(If you want to test with a sample track file, click here to load a __dt_tcga__)

The suite of tracks is the different transcription factors for a given cell type (collected in a GSuite).  It should be constructed using __page_cg__, for instance the tool __bs_tool__. (If you want to test with a sample track suite, click here to load a __dgs_tf_gm12878__)

After the necessary data (query track and track suite) has been collected to Galaxy history, the track of variants can be analyzed against active regions using the tool __tc_tool__.
	- (more options are in the process of being made available)	
- Explore transcription factor binding (TF Chip-seq)	
	- What is the similarity of binding for different TFs in a given cell type	
		For most analyses of similarity of binding, the first step would be to get an appropriate suite of binding regions for different transcription factors. This can be constructed using __page_cg__, for instance the tool __bs_tool__. (If you want to test with a sample track suite, click here to load a __dgs_tf_gm12878__).

The similarity between TFs in a suite can then be explored in different ways:

One question is the degree to which binding regions are shared across TFs in a group, without focusing on the specifics of each TF. This can be explored through the tool __pp_obt_tool__.

A second question is how the different specific TFs bind similarly to each other. This can be explored by analyzing with __cc_tool__ by using the same GSuite as both input suites, or by exploring the hierarchical structure through a "clustering analysis of tracks in a GSuite".
	- Do different TFs seem to form groups/clusters based on similarity of which parts of the genome they appear to be regulating?	
		This question can be explored by analyzing the clustering tendency of tracks representing binding for different TFs. 

The question of the degree to which TFs form clusters is an instance of the more general question of "how a suite of tracks form clusters", basing the clustering on the similarity of how genomic elements of the tracks are distribution along the genome, where:

The suite of tracks is the binding regions for different transcription factors for a given cell type (collected in a GSuite).  It should be constructed using __page_cg__, for instance the tool __bs_tool__. (If you want to test with a sample track suite, click here to load a __dgs_tf_gm12878__).

After the track suite has been constructed in the Galaxy history,  the tracks of binding regions can be explored using the tool "clustering analysis of tracks in a GSuite”.
	- How much does binding for a given TF vary across cell types	
		This can be explored similarly to the question "What is the similarity of binding for different TFs in a given cell type" (see above), by using binding data for the same TF across cell types (rather than binding data for different TFs in the same cell type). More specifically:

The suite of tracks is the binding regions for a transcription factor of interest for different cell types (one track per cell type, collected in a GSuite).  It should be constructed using __page_cg__, for instance the tool __bs_tool__. (If you want to test with a sample track suite, click here to load a __dgs_cmyc__).

After the track suite has been constructed in the Galaxy history, it can be analyzed using the tool __pp_obt_tool__.
	- Which TFs have the most typical and the most unique binding regions in relation to a suite of TFs?	
		To explore this question, one would start with binding regions for a group of selected TFs, with the binding regions of each TF represented as a separate track in a GSuite. The question can be explored by analyzing for each TF how similar the binding regions of that track is to the locations annotated in the remaining tracks in the group. This can produce a ranking of TFs, from the TF showing highest average similarity to other tracks to the TF showing lowest similarity (highest uniqueness). This can be seen as a concrete instance of the more general question "Given a suite of tracks, which tracks are most typical and most unique relative to the other tracks in the suite", where: 

The suite of tracks is the binding regions for different transcription factors for a given cell type (collected in a GSuite).  It should be constructed using __page_cg__, for instance the tool __bs_tool__. (If you want to test with a sample track suite, click here to load a __dgs_tf_gm12878__).

The question of which TFs have the most typical and most unique binding regions can then be explored using the tool __pp_obt_tool__. 
	- In which cell types do motif-based binding site predictions for a given TF fall in regulatory active regions (unfinished)	
		This question can be explored by analyzing enrichment of the motif-based binding site predictions in active regions of several cell types. Various genomic features can be used as a proxy for active regions of a cell type, including DNaseI accessibility, FAIRE or specific histone modifications like H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. 

The question of whether the binding regions fall in active regions (DNase HS/FAIRE/Histone Chip-Seq) across cell types can be seen as a concrete instance of the more general question "How does a single genomic track overlap with various other tracks from a suite", where: .... (standard..)
	- In which chromatin states (promoter, enhancer) do binding regions for a TF primarily fall (in a given cell type)? (unfinished)	
		This question can be explored by analyzing enrichment of the binding locations within regions associated with different chromatin states in a cell of interest. Various genomic tracks can be used to denote chromatin state (various forms of promoter, enhancer and more) including individual histone modifications or chromatin state tracks constructed computationally from combinations of several histone modifications. 

The question of whether binding regions fall in particular chromatin states (Histone Chip-Seq, computationally constructed tracks) in a given cell type can be seen as a concrete instance of the more general question "How does a single genomic track overlap with various other tracks from a suite", where: .... (standard..)
	- Do binding regions for a TF overlap DNA variants associated to particular traits? (unfinished)	
		This question can be explored by analyzing enrichment of DNA variants of different traits in the binding regions of a transcription factor (TF) of interest. Variant locations of different traits will typically be in the form of annotated lead SNPs found through a GWAS for a particular trait.

The question of whether binding regions overlap preferentially with DNA variants of various traits can be seen as a concrete instance of the more general question "How does a single genomic track overlap with various other tracks from a suite", where: .... (standard..)
