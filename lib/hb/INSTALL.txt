=====================================
 INSTALLING THE GENOMIC HYPERBROWSER
=====================================

*** Software requirements

The following pieces of software must be installed prior to installing
the Genomic HyperBrowser:

- Python 2.7
- R 2.13.2 or later
- Perl 5.8 or later
- Numpy 1.7.0b1 or later
- Cairo 1.8.10 or later
- Libzmq 2.1.10 or later
- Xvfb
- ImageMagick 6.2.8 or later
- rsync
- Graphviz

Make sure that all software is available for the setup script (e.g. using PATH,
PYTHONPATH, RHOME and R_LIBS paths.)


*** Installation procedure

1. Download the supported Galaxy-version from Galaxy-dist
  (https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-dist)

     Unpack Galaxy in the directory of your choice.

   Optionally use mercurial to clone the repository:

     hg clone https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-dist

2. Enter the Galaxy folder and start Galaxy:

     ./run.sh --daemon

   Note that it may take several minutes first time due to compiling of Python packages.

   Watch paster.log for any errors.

      ./run.sh --stop-daemon

3. Download HyperBrowser source code package and unpack it to a different folder
   than Galaxy. To obtain the latest version, you need to make sure that SVN is
   installed on your computer. Then, please type the following:type the
   following:

     svn co svn://invitro.titan.uio.no/projects/bioinfoprojects/hyperbrowser_dist/trunk hyperbrowser_dist</pre>

4. Enter the HyperBrowser folder and run this command:

     python setup.py -g [path to Galaxy folder]

   Note the setup script may take several minutes to finish. This is due to
   compiling of R packages and preprocessing of data.

   The setup script patches several of the files in the Galaxy folder. There
   may arise conflicts under the installation. If so, please edit the file
   in question manually, including the new additions, and try again.

5. Enter the Galaxy folder and start Galaxy once more:

     ./run.sh --daemon

   Watch paster.log for any errors.

6. In order to configure your installation further, please edit the universe.wsgi.ini file according to a normal
   Galaxy installation. One option that should be changed, for security, is the 'id_secret' config.

   For configuration of your HyperBrowser installation, please edit the config/LocalOSConfig file. More general
   configurations can be found in the config/Config.py file.

If you encounter any problems, feel free to contact us at hyperbrowser-bugs@usit.uio.no. Note that the Genomic
HyperBrowser currently does not support updating an existing installation running on an older Galaxy version.
If this is important for you, please contact us.
