        <h1>The Genomic HyperBrowser Web Portal Service Agreement</h1>

        <p>
        1) <em>Use of Service.</em>
        <ul>
        <li>The Genomic HyperBrowser Web Portal is a free, public, Internet accessible resource (the "Service"). The Service makes use of the Galaxy platform ("Galaxy") in the core of its web framework, and is subject to limitations inherent in Galaxy.</li>
        <li>All use of the Service also assumes that you comply with the University of Oslo ("UiO") regulations for usage of IT at UiO (<a href="http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/username-password/rules/index.html">http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/username-password/rules/index.html</a>)</li>
        <li>Data transfer and data storage are not encrypted. If there are restrictions on the way your research data can be stored and used, please consult your local institutional review board or the project principal investigator before uploading it to any public site, including this Service. If you have protected data or large data storage requirements, you are encouraged to set up your own local Genomic HyperBrowser instance and not use this Service.</li>
        <li>The Service may not be used for storing or processing sensitive data, meaning that for instance human health data and personal DNA sequences should not be used here. For research on sensitive data or related questions, please contact <a href="mailto:tsd-drift@hjelp.uio.no">tsd-drift@hjelp.uio.no</a>.</li>
        <li>We do not give any guarantees with respect to data integrity. In particular, we do not recommend that data is stored within the Service without an external copy or backup.</li>
        <li>Your access to the Service may be revoked at any time for reasons deemed necessary by the operators of the Service.</li>
        <li>Links in the Service Web Portal may navigate you to external web sites. Please note that these external web sites will have their own policies that may deviate from the ones listed here.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        2) <em>Privacy Policy and Service Limitations.</em>
        <ul>
        <li>You may choose to register an account with the Service. Your registration data is primarily used so you may persistently store data on the Service and use advanced Galaxy features such as sharing and workflows.</li>
        <li>The Service may store the email address of the user, as well as uploaded data, usage logs, and other user-generated content. The operators of the Service will not provide your registration data to any third party unless required to do so by law.</li>
        <li>The Service is using cookies to provide persistence in the user experience. No personal information is stored in cookies, only anonymous non-identifiable placeholders.</li>
        <li>Web traffic to our services will be analysed and results used for further development of the Service.</li>
        <li>Your access to the Service is provided under the condition that you abide by any published quotas on data storage, job submissions, or any other limitations placed on the public Service.</li>
        <li>Attempts to subvert these limits by creating multiple accounts or through any other method may result in termination of all associated accounts.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        3) <em>Disclaimer.</em> The Service is provided to you on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this service agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
        4) <em>Limitation of Liability.</em> Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall The University of Oslo or any other entity which provides resources for the Service be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of the use of this Service including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.
